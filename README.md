🩺 Disease Detector

📌 Overview
The Disease Detector is a machine learning project designed to predict diseases based on patient health data. The model is trained using classification techniques to analyze symptoms/medical attributes and provide predictions that can assist in healthcare diagnostics.

This project is implemented in Python with Jupyter Notebook and leverages machine learning libraries for training and evaluation.


🚀 Features
Data preprocessing and cleaning for health-related datasets Training ML models for disease prediction Model evaluation with accuracy and metrics Exporting trained model for reuse Easy-to-use interface via Jupyter Notebook


🤖 Technologies used (and why)
•Python: main language.
•Google Colab: cloud notebook; easy GPU/CPU, file upload.
•Kaggle API (kaggle.json): credentials setup (you prepared it; not strictly used to download in the shown code).
•pandas: data loading, cleaning, feature engineering.
•matplotlib & seaborn: histograms, heatmaps, feature-importance plots.
•scikit-learn: 
    train_test_split, StandardScaler
    Models: LogisticRegression, RandomForestClassifier
    Metrics: accuracy_score, classification_report, confusion_matrix
•joblib: save/load trained model and scaler to/from disk.


⚙️ Installation
Clone the repository: git clone 
Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended): python -m venv venv source venv/bin/activate # On Linux/Mac venv\Scripts\activate # On Windows
Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt


▶️ Usage
Open Colab Notebook:
Run the Disease_Detector.ipynb file step by step.
Train the model and generate predictions.
(Optional) Use the saved model (.pkl file) for deployment in other applications.


📊 Example Workflow Load dataset Preprocess data Train ML model (Random Forest / Logistic Regression / etc.) Evaluate accuracy, confusion matrix Save trained model for later usage
